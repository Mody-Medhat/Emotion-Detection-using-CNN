# Emotion Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project focuses on emotion detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary goal is to train a model that can accurately classify facial expressions into different emotions. The project utilizes the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle, containing images labeled with seven different emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

## Project Structure
- **Emotion Detection using CNN.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for building and training the CNN model.
- **Datasets/FER-2013**: Directory for storing the FER-2013 dataset.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mody-Medhat/Emotion-Detection-using-CNN.git
   cd Emotion-Detection-using-CNN

2. **Download the FER-2013 Dataset:**
Download the FER-2013 dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and place the contents in the `Datasets/FER-2013` directory.

3. **Open and Run the Notebook:**
Open the `Emotion Detection using CNN.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and follow the instructions to train and evaluate the CNN model.
